# What does this mod do?
This mod allows you to easily dynamically change your client brand through a simple command. Note: You must rejoin a server for this to work.
# What is this used for?
While it may not have any practical uses, I like to use it to troll my friends/staff on Minecraft servers by changing my client brand to a phrase that includes their username due to certain plugins showing the client brand of a player to staff members when the player joins. (E.g. Vulcan).
# How can I help?
You can help by giving me ideas on what to add to the mod and by [starring the project on Github](https://github.com/cooldma/Client-Renamer).
